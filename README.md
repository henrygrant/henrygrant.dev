# Henry Grant Link Site
henrygrant.dev is a simple site that provides links to places people can find me. It will likely change over time, but frankly I needed to something for that url to land on. I mean, I paid for it, right? 

The source code is all here, and the app is hosted on Vercel. You can see it live [here](henrygrant.dev).
